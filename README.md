# Intro Course Project App of Christian Devin for the iPraktikum

To pass the intro course, you need to create your own unique iOS app (based on SwiftUI).

There are no requirements regarding the functions of your app, so you can get creative.
However, we provide you with Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) that your app needs to fulfill.

After each day of learning new Swift and SwiftUI concepts, these NFRs may change, or new NFRs get added.

## Submission procedure

You get a **personal repository** on Gitlab to work on your app.

Once you implemented a new feature into your app, you need to create a Merge Request (MR - Sometimes we will also reference these as "Pull Requests"(PR)) to merge your changes from the feature branch into your main branch.

Your tutor will review your changes and either request changes or approves the MR.

If your MR got approved, you also need to merge it!

### Deadline: **15.10.2024 23:59**

Until the deadline all of your PRs **need to be merged** and your final app **needs to fulfill** all of the requested NFRs!

## Problem Statement (max. 500 words)

As a student who lives independently, it can be quite challenging, dividing your time between studies and doing household stuff. Cooking is one of the things I spend a lot of time to think about. I usually only buy groceries once a week, and hence I need to plan my meal plan accordingly in advance. And sometimes, it's not easy to find a meal plan idea for the whole week only in one day.

To help me overcome this challenge, I need an iOS application that can help me to generate meal recipes for me. I can maybe input a few key ingredients, and this app (with the help of AI) will generete a suitable recipe for me.

Additionally, the app should be able to store the recipes that has been generated. This overview should be easy to navigate.
## Requirements

TODO: Document the requirements you fulfilled with your app. Discuss them with your tutor.

## Analysis

TODO: Include an analysis object model. You can use [draw.io](https://draw.io) or [apollon](https://apollon.ase.cit.tum.de) to create it. Please add all models as an Image - not as a link!

## System Design

TODO: Include a system design overview describing your application.

## Product Backlog

TODO: Add a product backlog and don't forget to update it with each MR.
